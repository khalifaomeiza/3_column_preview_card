RESPONSIVE WEB DEVELOPMENT


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  
    @media (max-width: 800px) {
        .car-brands{
            display:block;
            margin: 30px auto;
            max-width:250px;
            height: 1200px;
        }

        .brand-name {
            padding: 20px 0px;
        }

}
}
```

- In making the design responsive.
